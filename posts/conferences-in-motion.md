My LinkedIn feed has been filling me with green-eyed envy because so many of my connections attended the [International Back and Neck Pain Forum](https://www.ebpi.uzh.ch/en/activities/ibnpforum2025.html) this week in Davos, Switzerland.

The organizers got creative and held multiple parallel sessions of presentations while hiking trails in the Swiss Alps! From what I can tell, there were varied levels of difficulty and distance, and many ended at a restaurant or other scenic site.

I love the idea, but canâ€™t help but wonder about the experienceâ€¦

- How do you keep everyone together? 
- Did the organizers consult risk management? 
- Were emergency services on stand by?
- How do attendees pick which session?[^1]
- Could everyone hear?[^2]

In one video I saw, the speaker was standing on a berm using his phone for notes. The audience were standing around and many had their phones out, presumably following along (slides? a PDF? webpage? [slides as a webpage](https://ia.net/presenter/support/action/sharing)?).

### Have you experienced a conference session like this? 

Iâ€™ve heard of [wilderness medicine](https://wms.org/WMS/WMS/Attend/Conferences/Overview.aspx?hkey=d3ec01ea-ec12-41c1-9ba7-d5009f5a0468) and been to [ultra running conferences](https://ultrasportsscience.us/2014-1st-annual-congress/) all about science in the outdoors, but the closest we got was a practical session (blister care) outside the venue (and, of course, casual discussion during morning trail runs).

I really hope the IBNPF organizers report on the experiment. 

What data would you collect beyond attendee satisfaction measuresâ€“total distance hiked, calories burned, average heart rate over time?

### Variations on the movement

I shared these thoughts to the [ScienceUX](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceUX/comments/1lm26rj/conference_presentations_in_motion/) subreddit and got some other suggestions for ways to incorporate the hikes other than presentations-in-motion.

I particularly like the idea of post-talk sense making! Instead of everyone surrounding the speaker next to the podium for follow up questions, the speaker should get a 5-min head start and whoever catches her first gets to ask their questions. ðŸ¤£

[^1]: I already hate having to pick between parallel sessions, now you add in fitness considerations!

[^2]: Itâ€™s notoriously difficult to hear people in front of you on a trail, especially on narrow single track when the group starts to naturally spread out.
